# Syllabus


This course is a 12 step program for asking and answering scientific questions using data science practices.
We will cover the fundamentals of doing data science research, explaining "best practices" for each step, that collectively comprise the upward spiral of science.  These steps include: 

1. asking an interesting question,
2. determining the degree to which the answer is known, 
3. assessing the degree to which (or probability) existing data is sufficient to obtain a satisfactory answer, 
4. exploring the data set, 
5. cleaning up the dataset, 
6. formalizing a statistical inquiry, 
7. positing a statistical model which we hope will yield satisfactory answers, 
8. devising a test to assess the answer, 
9. building an estimator to assess the model, 
10. checking the model, 
11. reporting the results, 
12. suggesting the next experiment to perform or question to answer to further enhance the model.

Note that this course will largely be project based; each student will be expected to complete each of the above steps on some real data of interest to the student.  Lectures will be minimal, giving introductory explanations one day, hopefully only part of the time.  The rest of the time, I expect we will work independently or in small groups to complete the weekly portion of the overall project.  

No courses are formally required, though students will need to write numerical code (in R, Python, or Julia), and make reports using something like LaTeX, knitr, or Jupyter notebooks.  All code and reports will be *open*, that means using *open access data* and *open source code*.

Please come ready to do science! If you don't have questions that you want answered, you can work in small groups, but each student will need to write the code and reports on their own.  There will be no "homeworks".

- *Grading*: Each week each group will be responsible for handing in an updated report.  Grade will be: A assuming it comes in on time, B if it comes in late, C if it never comes in.  Total grade will be an average over all weeks.
- *Pweweqs*: I assume you are comfortable with all the content in https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science
