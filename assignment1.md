in your project repo, create a folder called 'Draft', in it, create a markdown file called 'summary.md'
it should contain:

- title of your project
- authors (team mates)
- 1 paragraph on 'opportunity'
- 1 paragraph on 'significance'
- 1 paragraph on 'feasibility'
- 1 paragraph on 'innovation'
- label each paragraph as such
