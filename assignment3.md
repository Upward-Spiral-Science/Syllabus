1. start answering questions, all questions must be answered in a jupyter notebook if you are using R/Python.  
if you are using MATLAB, it is probably too annoying to get the MATLAB kernel working with a jupyter notebook, 
so you can use the "publish" function in MATLAB. 
in any case, we will run your code, if it answers the questions you said it answers, that's an A.
if not, B.
all descriptive & exploratory questions should be answered.

2. create a new md file with your list of questions, but modify the original list to reflect the changes in the questions that you made in the process.
this means writing down new questions that you didn't ask before, 
striking out old questions and explaining why they were not answered,
etc. 

as always, grellium has examples, follow the formatting exactly, ask us questions NLT than thursday if you have them.
