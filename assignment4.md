make a jupyter notebook with the following:

0. state assumptions about your data
1. formally define statistical test
2. provide algorithm for implementing test
3. sample data from an element of the  null model, and plot power vs. n (power should be at alpha)
4. sample data from an element of the alternative model, and plot power vs. n (power should increase to 1)
5. compute p-value on your real data 
6. explain the degree to which you believe the result and why
