make a jupyter notebook with the following:

0. state assumptions about your data
1. formally define classification/regression problem
2. provide algorithm for solving problem (including choosing hyperparameters as appropriate)
3. sample data from a simulation setting inspired by your data (both null and alternate models)
5. compute accuracy
6. plot accuracy vs. sample size in simulation
7. apply method directly on real data
6. explain the degree to which you believe the result and why
