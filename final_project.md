Each group must complete a detailed report of all of the work they have done throughout
the course. The expectations of this report are:

- Figures should be *perfect* (as discussed in class)
- Report summarizes all analyses perfomed throughout the course
- At the end, report suggests next steps if this work were to be continued
- The report is uploaded in the base directory of the group's repository, and entitled `final_report.md`
- The report is to be written in markdown.
- All repository organization must comply with that suggested in the syllabus (i.e. follow the example set by the TA)
