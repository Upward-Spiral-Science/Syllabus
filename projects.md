## Project Topics

####3D Distribution of Synapses in Cortex
From annotated electron microscopy (EM) images we can analyze properties of neurons and organelles, including the distribution of synapses between neurons in space. Are synapses evenly distributed in the cortex? If not, what distribution are they sampled from?

#### Synapse Diversity in terms of Gene Expression

Cell type diversity is a fundamental anatomical property of cells that underlies our understanding of essentially all organs.  There is a massive collective effort underway right now in neuroscience to discover the diversity of cell types.  However, cells in the brain communicate via synapses.  Because each synapse has two parent neurons, their types might be far more complicated and important.  Yet, there has been no analysis so far on characterizing synapse type, especially with regard to gene expression information.

####Does Processing all Brains Using the Same Pipeline Improve Inference?
Data can be collected many different ways even within the same modality. For instance, Diffusion MRI data from two separate facilities or studies can look almost nothing alike. Considering this, does processing all data with the same set of parameters and a unified pipeline improve the quality of downstream inference results on the produced graphs?

####Insights from SPECT Imaging
SPECT imaging is a technique used by Daniel Amen to assess and aid in diagnosis of psychological disorders, brain injury, and other neurological diseases. Can we train a classifier to recognize the patterns seen by experts in this data and aid in diagnosis?

####Semiparametric Testing of Creativity in Humans
Creativity can be evaluated much like IQ through a metric called the composite creativity index (CCI). Given CCI scores and paired brain graph estimates from subjects, can we identifty conectivity between certain structures in the brain that are associated to higher creativity? Similarly, is connectivity in other regions linked to lower creativity?

 #### Whole Brain Structure from CLARITY

We have about 12 brains all of which have been imaged using CLARITY techniques.  One can see cells and processes lit up through the brain, and there are multiple different conditions (normal, shock, addict).  The question is: are there global structural differences across the brains? This project will require a bit of computer vision to do local histogram equalization and such.

#### Cell Density Maps Across the Brain

Also from CLARITY data, also requiring some computer vision.  In this project, you will find cells, and estimate relative number of cells in each ROI, and then do some statistical analysis comparing different ROIs.  Same references as above.
