## Project Topics

####3D Distribution of Synapses in Cortex
From annotated electron microscopy (EM) images we can analyze properties of neurons and organelles, including the distribution of synapses between neurons in space. Are synapses evenly distributed in the cortex? If not, what distribution are they sampled from?

####Effect of Cortical Gene Expression on Synapse Diversity

####Does Processing all Brains Using the Same Pipeline Improve Inference?
Data can be collected many different ways even within the same modality. For instance, Diffusion MRI data from two separate facilities or studies can look almost nothing alike. Considering this, does processing all data with the same set of parameters and a unified pipeline improve the quality of downstream inference results on the produced graphs?

####Insights from SPECT Imaging
SPECT imaging is a technique used by Daniel Amen to assess and aid in diagnosis of psychological disorders, brain injury, and other neurological diseases. Can we train a classifier to recognize the patterns seen by experts in this data and aid in diagnosis?

####Semiparametric Testing of Creativity in Humans
Creativity can be evaluated much like IQ through a metric called the composite creativity index (CCI). Given CCI scores and paired brain graph estimates from subjects, can we identifty conectivity between certain structures in the brain that are associated to higher creativity? Similarly, is connectivity in other regions linked to lower creativity?
